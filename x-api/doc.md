PROJECT NAME:
<h1>Student API</h1>

The "Student API" is a simulated tool developed in nodejs and MongoClient of MongoDB, but it is not a genuine student data API. <br>
It has been created exclusively for the purpose of providing a platform for students to learn and practice API programming skills. And it is not intended to be used in any real-world application or context, but rather as a tool to help students gain experience with the technologies involved.
