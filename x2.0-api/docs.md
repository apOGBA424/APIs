## DESCRIPTION

This is a second project in my series of learning to create API.<br>However, it is not a continuation of my first API, [<b>x-api</b>](https://github.com/apOGBA424/APIs/tree/main/x-api 'Click to visit " x-api " github repository').<br><br>

### FEATURES
Though this project shares same technologies as seen in the<br> previous API, however few changes were made by the<br> introduction of [***Mongoose***](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose 'Click to learn more'), a third-party NPM package for<br> MongoDB, to replace MongoClient( ) object that comes with<br> MongoDB package. <br><br>
